6. **Naïve Bayesian Classifier Implementation**
   - Description: This program implements the naïve Bayesian classifier and computes its accuracy on test data sets stored as CSV files.
   - File: [NaiveBayesianClassifier.py](Programs/NaiveBayesianClassifier.py)

7. **Linear Regression Model Implementation**
   - Description: This program implements the Linear Regression model using a sample training data set stored in a CSV file.
   - File: [LinearRegression.py](Programs/LinearRegression.py)

8. **Decision Tree ID3 Algorithm**
   - Description: This program implements the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree and classify new samples.
   - File: [DecisionTreeID3.py](Programs/DecisionTreeID3.py)

9. **Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation**
   - Description: This program builds an Artificial Neural Network using the Backpropagation algorithm and tests it with appropriate data sets.
   - File: [NeuralNetworkBackpropagation.py](Programs/NeuralNetworkBackpropagation.py)

10. **Computer Vision Concepts: Image Processing**
    - Description: This program utilizes Computer Vision concepts to process an image, apply gray shading filters, perform edge detection using the Canny method, and perform face detection.
    - File: [ImageProcessing.py](Programs/ImageProcessing.py)

## Data Sets

The data sets used for training and testing the programs are located in the [Data sets](Data%20sets/) folder.

## Usage

1 Open the ai_lab_2023.ipynb file in Google Colab to run and experiment with the programs.
2. Clone the repository:
   Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.

   Navigate to the directory where you want to store the cloned repository using the `cd` command. For example:
   
   ```
   cd Documents
   ```
   
   Clone the repository by executing the following command (replace your-repo-name with the actual name of your repository):
   
    ``` bash
    git clone https://github.com/shrutin567/your-repo-name.git
