2. **Accessing Programs:**
   - The main Colab file for this repository is named `ai_lab_2023.ipynb`.

## Running the Programs

### Using Google Colab

1. Open the [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/shrutin567/Artificial-Intelligence-1-Lab/blob/main/ai_lab_2023.ipynb).
2. Log in with your Google account if required.
3. Make a copy of the notebook by clicking `File` > `Save a copy in Drive` or `Copy to Drive`.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run individual programs.

### Locally

1. Navigate to the program's directory, e.g., `DFS`.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (if any).
3. Run the program using the appropriate command, e.g., `python DFS.py`.
