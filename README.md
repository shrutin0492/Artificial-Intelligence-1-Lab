Programs as part of the Artificial Intelligence-1 Laboratory course in my 2nd year of undergrad.

1. Write a program to implement Breadth First Search. 
2. Write a program to implement Depth First Search.
3. Write a program to implement the Tower of Hanoi problem.
4. Write a program to use reinforcement learning through an agent and obtain the results for the grid world example.
5. For a given set of training data examples stored in a .CSV file, implement and demonstrate the Candidate-Elimination Algorithm to output a description of the set of all hypotheses consistent with the training examples.
6. Write a program to implement the na√Øve Bayesian classifier for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file. Compute the accuracy of the classifier, considering few test data sets.
7. Write a program to implement the Linear Regression model for a sample training data set stored as a .CSV file.
8. Write a program to demonstrate the working of the decision tree based ID3 algorithm. Use an appropriate data set for building the decision tree and apply this knowledge to classify a new sample.
9.  Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.
10. Write a python program to use the concepts of Computer Vision to read an image and obtain the gray shading filters modify it and use filters to obtain the edge detection using canny method and face detection.
