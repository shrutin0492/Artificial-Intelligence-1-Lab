## Programs List

1. **Breadth First Search (BFS) Implementation**
   - Description: This program implements the Breadth First Search algorithm.
     
2. **Depth First Search (DFS) Implementation**
   - Description: This program implements the Depth First Search algorithm.

3. **Tower of Hanoi Problem**
   - Description: This program solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using a recursive approach.

4. **Reinforcement Learning with Grid World**
   - Description: This program uses reinforcement learning to solve a grid world example.

5. **Candidate-Elimination Algorithm Implementation**
   - Description: This program implements the Candidate-Elimination Algorithm and outputs hypotheses consistent with training examples from a CSV file.

6. **Naïve Bayesian Classifier Implementation**
   - Description: This program implements the naïve Bayesian classifier and computes its accuracy on test data sets stored as CSV files.

7. **Linear Regression Model Implementation**
   - Description: This program implements the Linear Regression model using a sample training data set stored in a CSV file.

8. **Decision Tree ID3 Algorithm**
   - Description: This program implements the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree and classify new samples.

9. **Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation**
   - Description: This program builds an Artificial Neural Network using the Backpropagation algorithm and tests it with appropriate data sets.

10. **Computer Vision Concepts: Image Processing**
    - Description: This program utilizes Computer Vision concepts to process an image, apply gray shading filters, perform edge detection using the Canny method, and perform face detection.

## Data Sets

The data sets used in the programs are located in the [Data sets](Data%20sets/) folder.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `ai_lab_2023.ipynb` file in Google Colab to run and experiment with the programs.
