8. **Decision Tree ID3 Algorithm**
   - Description: This program implements the ID3 algorithm to build a decision tree and classify new samples.
   - File: [DecisionTreeID3.py](DecisionTreeID3.py)

9. **Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation**
   - Description: This program builds an Artificial Neural Network using the Backpropagation algorithm and tests it with appropriate data sets.
   - File: [NeuralNetworkBackpropagation.py](NeuralNetworkBackpropagation.py)

10. **Computer Vision Concepts: Image Processing**
    - Description: This program utilizes Computer Vision concepts to process an image, apply gray shading filters, perform edge detection using the Canny method, and perform face detection.
    - File: [ImageProcessing.py](ImageProcessing.py)

## Data Sets

The data sets used for training and testing the programs are located in the [Data sets](Data%20sets/) folder.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `ai_lab_2023.ipynb` file in Google Colab to run and experiment with the programs.

Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the code provided in this repository.
